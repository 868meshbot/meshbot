# MeshBot

![Meshbot](./img/meshbot.png)

MeshBot is an OpenSource Python program designed to run on computers with a connected Meshtastic device, allowing users to send and receive messages efficiently over a mesh network.

Our Mission: 
 - To provied low-bandwidth functionality to a low bandwidth mesh.  This has originated in the EU where we have 1x longfast channel, and 10% duty cycle, so we try hard to make this low bandwidth, efficent, purposeful and helpful.  
 - For those outside of the EU, knock yourselves out, its opensource, modify at will. Just please dont be offended if we reject high bandwidth pull-requests, but we have no issues with extending commands.
 - As we are open source and an open community, please publish and share your meshtastic work. 

## Features

- Broadcast messages: Send text broadcasts to all devices on the mesh network.
- Weather updates: Get real-time weather updates for a specified location.
- Tides information: Receive tidal information for coastal areas.
- Whois: Query one of two User databases: mpowered247 or liamcottle
- Simple BBS: Store and retrieve messages via the bot

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Meshtastic Python library
- Access to a Meshtastic device [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org)
- Serial drivers for your meshtastic device, See [Installing Serial Drivers](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/serial-drivers/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/868meshbot/meshbot.git
```

2. Navigate into the folder and setup a virtual environment

```
cd meshbot
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Connect your Meshtastic device to your computer via USB and run the program

```
python ./meshbot.py
```

## Configuration (NEW)

We have revamped the configuration, there is now a ''settings.yaml'' file, which we believe makes the program easier to manage

Example Content:

```
---
LOCATION: "Swansea"
TIDE_LOCATION: "Swansea"
MYNODE: "3663493700"
MYNODES:
  - "3663493700"
  - "1234567890"
DBFILENAME: "./db/nodes.db"
DM_MODE: True
FIREWALL: True
DUTYCYCLE: True
```

Description

- LOCATION and TIDE_LOCATION = These should be obvious
- MYNODE = The hw address of the node connected in int/number form. This is so the bot only responds to DMs
- MYNODES = A list of nodes (in int/number form) that are permitted to interact with the bot
- DBFILENAME = Configure which user database file to use by default
- DM_MODE = True: Only respond to DMs; False: responds to all traffic
- FIREWALL = True: Only respond to MYNODES; False: responds to all traffic
- DUTYCYCLE: True: Respect 10% Dutycycle in EU, false to disable for countries without Dutycycle

## Usage

Run the MeshBot program:

```
python meshbot.py --help
```

Example on Linux:

```
python meshbot.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Example on OSX:

```
python meshbot.py --port /dev/cu.usbserial-0001
```

Example on Windows:

```
python meshbot.py --port COM7
```

## Bot interaction

You bot will be accessible through the meshtastic mesh network through the node name. DM the bot/node and issue any of the following commands:

- #test : receive a test message
- #test-detail : as #test above only more detail e.g snr,rssi, hop count (thanks to [rohanki](https://github.com/rohanki))
- #weather : local weather report
- #tides : tide info (dont forget to change the default town in the source)
- #whois #xxxx : retrieve name and node info for a node based on last 4 chars of address
- #bbs any : do I have any messages?
- #bbs post !address message : post a message on the bbs for a given user at !address
- #bbs get : retrieve your message(s) left by another user(s)
